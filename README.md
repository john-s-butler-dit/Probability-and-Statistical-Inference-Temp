## Maths in the Wild

Maths in the Wild consists of five workshops designed for primary and secondary school students. Participants engage in interactive experiments and mathematical calculations, allowing them to experience firsthand how maths and science, mainly neuroscience, are applied in exploring and understanding our surroundings.

The workshops were written by John Butler, a maths lecturer at Technological University Dublin. John combines his knowledge of mathematics and neuroscience to create experiments and analysis techniques that let us explore the world through maths.
