title: Maths in the Wild
---


**Maths in the Wild** consists of five workshops designed for primary and secondary school students. Participants engage in interactive experiments and mathematical calculations, allowing them to experience firsthand how maths and science, mainly neuroscience, are applied in exploring and understanding our surroundings.

The workshops were written by 
[John Butler](https://johnsbutler.netlify.app), 
a maths lecturer at Technological
University Dublin. John combines his knowledge
of mathematics and neuroscience to create
experiments and analysis techniques that
let us explore the world through maths.

## Workshops
1. [Predator Prey](01_Predator_Prey/index.md)
2. [Machine Learning](02_NeuroAI/index.md)
3. [Multisensory Integration](03_Multisensory/index.md)
4. [Decision Making](04_DecisionMaking/index.md)
5. [Face Recognition](05_EigenFaces/index.md)

Each workshop has a presentation, a video, some code and worksheet, which is freely available for anyone who wants to use them.
